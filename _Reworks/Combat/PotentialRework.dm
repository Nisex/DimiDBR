	/*
		Each tier of power increases the mult that you have, increasing ur overall power aka damage etc.
		the issue rn is that this is set up for 1-100, which is rigid and static, essentially there are 10 tiers of power and once you pass that there is no more scaling
		to fix that we need a dynamic calculation that will consistently get you a scaling mult depending on a variable
		the only issue is that a wipe runner does not know how long a wipe will be running for, and therefore the number is more like infinity than a variable itself

		Tiers
			F, E, D, C, B, A, S, SS, SSS, LEGENDARY, DIVINE, GODLY, OMNI, INFINITE
			these names are just cool names, they don't mean anything
			there are 14 tiers instead of 10, giving more room for dynamic scaling
		
		Variables
			CONSTANS
				MAX_TIERS
				POTENTIAL_HIGH_POINT
		Formula
			Input: 0-'ininfite'
			Output: 1-MAX_TIERS
