/*
Contract item
    needs to be able to be written on and "signed" by both parties
    the owner of the contract is always the summon, the summonable skill allows them to make a contract
    these contracts are bound to them, but can be destroyed or given away and destroyed (aka broken)
    the contract will take the key and name of the person as well as ask for a description
    furthermore it will ask for the actual goal of the contract aside from the description for ease

    vars
        summon : name+key of the person who made the contract
        summoner : name+key of the summoner
        description : description of the contract
        goal : goal of the contract
        signatures : list of names+keys of people who have signed the contract
        signed : boolean if the contract is signed or not
        sigKeys : list of keys of people who have signed the contract

    functions
        sign : signs the contract
        break : breaks the contract
        give : gives the contract to someone else
        write : writes on the contract
        read : reads the contract
        getSummon : gets the summoner
        getSummoner : gets the summoner
        getDesc : gets the description
        getGoal : gets the goal
        getSignatures : gets the signatures
        getSigned : gets if the contract is signed
        getSigKeys : gets the keys of the signatures
        completeContract : completes the contract
            this will delete the item, but also clear the variables in summonable skill, as well as the summoner's summon skill
