/*

let x = demon, y = holy and z = legendary

choice x y z

any choice gives Force + str scaling with pot/tier
	maybe scaling manastat w/ increase
	martial magic
	decreased void chance
	hats have a tier system to them, so its dual scaling


x = hellpower, scaling spirit sword = to tier + pot, sword punching, omnislash but cursed wounds vfx + cursed wounds, ultimate = dividing driver

y = holy power + spirit power, scaling hyprid strike, sword punching, giant aoe that makes space jtiles that fatigue and eat energy of ppl in it + heal u, ultimate = similar to gold cloth power up

z = legendary power, considered a staff, spirit flow, +spiritdamage, special move = homing bombs that manasteal/soulfire, do more dmgf the more mana/battery a person is missing, ultimate = wood golem

notes: p sure arcane beast ai is not functional

tiers:
	1 = path + Gravity ( waterwalk+godspeed+likewater+fluidform )
	2 = element passive + special move
	3 = ?
	4 = hat takeover mode(?) + ultimate
		an install or like symbiote i assume
