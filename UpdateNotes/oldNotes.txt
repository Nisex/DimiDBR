<li>Golden Form drains half as much.</li>
<li>Hiten Mitsurugi Tier 8 removes all fatigue costs from its techniques.</li>
<li>changeling</li>
<br>
<font size=+1>Fixes</font size>
<li>Cure, Curaga, Esuna, and Esunaga should turn off even if you don't have a captured target, which should bulletproof some buggy behavior.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>

the last, unless it's not</b><br>
<ul>
<font size=+1>Fixes</font size>
<li>Buster behaviors unstickified further ... hopefully. These are actually kinda fun.</li>
<li>Various fixes to screen colors getting stuck. If this happens to you, ask for admins to set "TsukiyomiTime to 1" and then turn RP mode off.</li>
<li>Purity influenced projectiles will no longer heal, which is bringing it in line to updated purity behavior.</li>
<br>
<font size=+1>Nerfs</font size>
<li>Magicite economy shot in the head. Kidding, it's just division by 2.5.</li>
<li>Judgment nerfed.</li>
<li>Makyo intimidation ignore scales with their ascension now.</li>
<br>
<font size=+1>Buffs</font size>

<li>Namekian Fusion removed from automation as you guys are literally incapable of not being dumbasses with it.</li>
<li>Soul Calibur's Noble Phantasm now operates under TurfShift effects, so it will eventually fade away. It also does a fuckton of damage to evil shit now, instead of just putting it in time out.</li>
<li>Nerfed a bug's ability to prevent someone from picking Titan Form. >:(</li>
<li>Evil Purity is no longer a feature. haha</li>
<li>Kai Shinjin can no longer get T3 skills through automation. Makai totally can though.</li>

health drain machine broke</b><br>
<ul>
<font size=+1>Nerfs...?</font size>
<li>Phylacteries will no longer leave you bleeding out.</li>
<li>Health Drain is no longer an aspect of finisher debuffs. In most cases it has been replaced with bleedhit on the afflicted.</li>
<li>Denjin Renki mana cost decreases as Ansatsuken level goes above 6.</li>
<li>Cure and Curaga are now once-a-fight spells.</li>
<li>Heal is also once a fight.</li>
<li>Spells that can only be used once a fight cannot be crested anymore.</li>
<li>Spells that are flagged as not being able to be implanted into a crest do not show up on the list anymore, rather than just denying them if they are attempted.</li>
<li>Magic Crests should automatically update with these changes and allow you to carve spells in them once again if some of them were removed.</li>
<li>Event Credit no longer gives you double the daily reward...??? i have brain damage</li>
<li>Event Credit will now properly go into economy charges once again, probably for quite some time, because of the aforementioned double event gains.</li>
<li>Enchanter Humans no longer get Grimoire Arcana for free.</li>
<li>Enchanter Namekians no longer get Grimoire Arcana for free.</li>
<li>Everyone lost their Grimoires because people cannot resist muling for Grimoires. It will be sorted out by admins if you have your grimoire returned to you. Nox Nyctores are exempt, mostly because they are cool.</li>
<li>Grimoire Arcana has no limits on the amount of grimoires it can make.</li>
<li>The number of Grimoires made this wipe has been reset, again with the exception of the Nox Nyctores.</li>
<br>
<font size=+1>Buffs</font size>
<li>Butcher's Finisher technique no longer does turf destruction, that was funny for like one wipe but I must protect the map.</li>
<li>Drunken Fist and Golden Kirin now have FluidForm attached to the style rather than the buff.</li>
<li>Drunken Fist gets erosion on the style rather than the finisher buff.</li>
<li>Golden Kirin gets a charge of flicker on the style rather than the finisher buff.</li>
<li>Butcher Style regains 2.5 slayer mod.</li>

</ul>

<b>07 / 21 / 2020<br>
saiyan machine broke</b><br>
<ul>
<font size=+1>Nerfs</font size>
<li>Saiyan auto-SSj moved back to 40 potential for SSj and 80 potential for SSj2. SSj3 will never be acquired automatically.</li>
<li>Trance Form now counts as a magic focus so that you can go into it without needing a focus. Knight Trance still disables your magic, though.</li>
<li>SSj2 intimidation scaled back from 50 to 30, SSj3 intimidation scaled from 70 to 50. SSj4 still gives 100 intimidation because it's cool.</li>
<li>SSj Grades automatically acquired at 60 potential. Saiyans don't have the capacity to get special slotters.</li>
<li>Legend of Black Heaven removed from the signature 3 selection pool. It is cool and an outlier and therefore shall not be available to the public.</li>
<li>Unbound Mode now properly occupies a Special Slot position. Its cooldown has been nerfed (it is no longer once a fight), and its lack of stat boosts has also been nerfed (meaning it gives boosts). The mana leak is higher.</li>
<li>Sparking Blast now provides a stable length of time that it is up for, stat boosts, and more sure-fire usefulness. It lasts for 25 seconds, and can only be triggered below 25% health. It is also a proper special slotter. It can also be only used once a battle!!</li>
<li>Saiyans lose access to special buffs that they can't use.</li>
<li>Everyone who picked Unbound Mode, Sparking Blast, or Legend of Black Heaven had it removed.</li>
<li>consent is important</li>
<li>SSj grades now adapt to your highest level of unlocked transformation.</li>
<li>Crystals of Reversal now return your saiyan tails if you've lost them.</li>
<li>Military Frame Special Slotters no longer have cooldowns.</li>
<li>Azure, True Azure, and Time Alter Grimoires are now counted as T3s.</li>
<li>Military Frames are now counted as T3s.</li>
<li>Buster techs that are interupted should no longer lock up the character until an admin fixes them. This is still technically a nerf maybe?!</li>
<li>Maybe-fix for the bug that locks people up after using a suplex-style grab technique to kill NPCs.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<b>07 / 19 / 2020<br>
did you say nerf everything?</b><br>
<ul>
<font size=+1>Nerfs</font size>
<li>Darkness Flame no longer forces debuffs to trigger on every attack. Only Ultima forces debuffs.</li>
<li>Styles that would amplify the amount of debuff stacks no longer do so. Attunement and elemental defenses are still taken into account.</li>
<li>Only Dragon Dash will proc Dragon Clashes. Grab no longer will do this.</li>
<li>Curaga no longer heals you for half your fucking health jesus christ.</li>
<li>All Hiten Mitsurugi techniques gain scaling cooldown. This is meant to represent the hypersonic attacks making the user's body weary as the battle goes on.</li>
<li>They also all accumulate fatigue, except Ryumeisen. Which one is that?</li>
<li>Traditional Hiten Mitsurugi no longer gets free BP and intimidation or recovery either. Why?</li>
<li>Battousai loses nowhiff and noforcedwhiff. Also intimidation.</li>
<li>Hiten Mitsurugi and Ansatsuken can no longer overcap on the style's Mastery in the higher tiers.</li>
<li>Denjin Renki loses nowhiff and noforcedwhiff. Mana cost increases to 100, timer limit decreases to 60 seconds, cooldown shortens to 120 seconds, loses CounterMaster but gains SoftStyle.</li>
<li>Satsui no Hado loses nowhiff and noforcedwhiff. Loses anger mult. Loses Abyssmod. Gains an extra charge of pursuer, and hardstyle.</li>
<li>Satsui no Hado no longer gives vaizard health when it has been mastered.</li>
<li>NPCs made weaker, unless they're epic. Those boys are still super dense.</li>
<li>Epic NPCs won't fight you on sight...hopefully.</li>
<li>Epic NPCs stat boosts are even beefier.</li>
<li>NPC drops refactored, again.</li>
<li>Fate of Blood's text is larger, so if you see it used in a spar, you can be like "hey, what the fuck?" and also possibly flick lethal on the person who used it under such circumstances.</li>
<li>Everything that had noforcedwhiff no longer has it, except Five Rings Style and Haki Armament.</li>
<li>Ray Gear no longer homes.</li>
<br>
<font size=+1>Buffs</font size>
<li>Five Rings Style now cripples and shears. It gains NoForcedWhiff. It gains another tick of triple strike. It's a spicy boy.</li>
<li>Battousai has a once a fight cooldown instead of 10 hours.</li>
<li>Battousai gives more flicker and instinct; contrast with Dance of the Full Moon which gives godspeed and deflection.</li>
<li>Hiten Mitsurugi ignores its scaling cooldowns when you hit Tier 8.</li>
<li>Parties can now share RPP gains!!!</li>
<li>West Star Style gains Water elemental class.</li>
<li>South Star Style gains Fire elemental class.</li>
<li>Fate of Blood only takes 10% health cut to trigger.</li>
<li>Fate of Blood won't take your life if you don't have weapon soul active ... Though you are still a retard if you attempt to use it under such circumstances. Flex tape can't fix that..</li>
<li>Event Credits will accumulate donate RPP as well!</li>
<li>New boss monsters!</li>
<li>Affect-other buffs now look for your target's icon state rather than your own.</li>
<br>
<font size=+1>Additionally</font size>
<li>Arcana.</li>
<li>Weapon Soul skill tree development has been uncapped (they can buy multiple upgrades of the same skill), and they get an upgraded T1/T2/T3/T4 skill at the respective saga level.</li>
<br>
<font size=+1>Even More Additionally</font size>
<li>Money economy tapped back, whoops.</li>
<li>Signature users are pulled in line with Saga users.</li>
<li>Special Strikes have delay once again.</li>
<li>Spirit Bow gains Radius 1. Ray Gear already had it so whatever.</li>
<li>Beastmen acquire enhanced smell and hearing at creation, Eldritch lose enhanced hearing but gain invisi-sight, Yokai pretty much remain the same.</li>
<li>Flicker contributes to how fast zanzoken charges return. Hiten go BRRRRRR.</li>
<li>Lesser levels of Soul Edge will not maintain BleedHit from the true form.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<b>07 / 15 / 2020<br>
basically the snakers + niezan update</b><br>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>Jinchuuriki removed as a signature option on account of the pole bankrolling the game. It still exists for the rest of the wipe, but you'll have to haggle with the admins to get it.</li>
<li>AI with higher potential can potentially give better gains! But there is a minimum as well.</li>
<li>Tomes and Magic Crests can see what spells are included in them by using the Examine verb on them.</li>
<li>White and Defensive magics no longer have absurdly large cooldowns.</li>
<li>Magic costs tapped back slightly for some of the more expensive shit.</li>
<li>A variety of autohits gained Hiten-like properties, allowing the launcher autohits to ... Actually be used to set up combos!!</li>
<li>Teleports are no longer usable when one is under the effects of movement seals.</li>
<li>Teleporters cannot ferry grabbed victims with them unless their version of teleporting is specifically flagged as one which supports passengers.</li>
<li>Summoners unlock telepathy with their summons one level earlier.</li>
<li>It locks up 75% of a summoner's capacity to draw a summon forth. It returns this capacity when the summon is dismissed. This is to prevent abrupt 1v3 situations while still maintaining the summoner's ability to get backup.</li>
<li>Eldritch will no longer gain Z-warping ability naturally, even though it was a really funny thing.</li>
<li>Empty Grimoire now unlocks Observe for free!</li>
<li>Tomes and Crests will factor into the logic of if you have enough mana to cast a spell.</li>
<li>Debuffs wear off more slowly.</li>

<li>Prodigy is no longer selectable as an alien racial. Brrrr.</li>

<li>Saiyans and Half Saiyans automatically acquire their transformations once they'd gain no transformation potential from using them. Automatically acquiring a transformation in this way means that there will not be a first time transformation heal.</li>
<li>Further refinements to Crackhead Knife style in terms of when punches and knives actually trigger.</li>

<li>Niezan reported a bug which allowed one to sneak a human out of their spawn box. Thematically, it mostly involved dying a lot. Voids now force you to release whoever you are holding when you go back to your body.</li>
<li>Movement mastery will now be recognized even if it isn't from a buff.</li>

<li>Fusion Dance was scaled back in passives. These passives can still be obtained with greater mastery. It might even have accurate power now.</li>
<li>Some crucial code was re-added to Fusion Dance. Hopefully the 'passenger' can hear and see once again.</li>
<li>The Sword T3 line was made obtainable.</li>
<li>Ki Armor no longer buffs end and defense. Why did I ever put that in?</li>
<li>Overhead Divide and Cross Slash REALLY traded places now.</li>
<li>Cross Slash is now a circle autohit because crosses are really awkward.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>AI</font size>
<li>The Gajalaka threat has been pacified and they will no longer start with a chance to be MURDEROUS.</li>
<li>Added code to make it variable how likely an AI is to be starving.</li>
<li>In relation with above, Scorpions and Spiders have a 25% chance to be hungry.</li>

<font size=+1>Party</font size>
<li>Parties should now reprimand the leader for trying to add AIs to the party. Likely.</li>

<li>Laser doors now have durability so they can't be slapped open.</li>

<li>Yokai monsters were changed to regenerate mana when they do not have an active buff on. This increases with their max mana amount.</li>
<li>The final ascension for Yokai monsters grants them ManaStats passive, but only while they have an active buff on.</li>
<li>In relation to the above two changes: these bonuses only apply when the Yokai is not mechanized.</li>
<li>Beastmen monsters now start at 150%. They do not ascend their maximum anger value anymore. The threshold of health needed to enter an anger state still rises, for a value of 50% at final ascension.</li>
<li>Beastmen Berserk grants 5% of super armor now.</li>
<li>Eldritch monsters should now be teachable.</li>
<li>"Celestial" monsters now gain twice as much MovementMastery per ascension, from 1 to 2.</li>

<li>"Infernal" monsters now only gain 10% anger max per ascension, down from 20%.</li>
<li>Saiyans can now gain Zenkai ascensions without voiding. Starting from 5 potential, and every 5 potential afterwards until 20, they will start gaining Zenkai EXP for injury that they heal off.</li>

Immediate Bug Revelations</b>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>Potential gains from slaughtering innocent NPCs has become more normalized. This is in hopes of making it feel like less of a waste to kill NPCs, for those who do not have murder genes in their blood.</li>
<li>Tweaked the Potential acquiring formula to compensate for the buy where you go over your soft cap.</li>
<li>Added some additional scaling reductions on Potential gain.</li>
<li>Scaled back potential on some of the people who were stacked as a result of above oversights; they will automatically be granted 7 days of EC RPP, which does stack with the below bonus for saiyans.</li>
<li>Money and items dropped by NPCs are set to have a very large amount of health. Hopefully this will prevent breaking them in a fit of lethal outrage.</li>
<li>Spawns can easily be swapped by admins. By using the Spawn-Swap verb. Incredible.</li>
<li>There are new types of doors that can only be opened by a person from a specific Spawn region. They must be set up by admins.</li>
<li>RPP-Refund will now also refund your daily potential soft cap. Thanks Niezan.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Skills</font size>
<li>Reorganized Cross Slash and Overhead Divide to better represent their category swap.</li>
<li>Added SwordOnly flag to Overhead Divide, whoops.</li>
<li>The Yes/No options are being unified to be No/Yes. So less people are confused on where they go to accept or deny a decision. Reading is dead.</li>
<li>Style Finishers now set your tension to -1 for the duration of the finisher buff, preventing you from gaining Tension while already in the finisher buff.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Party</font size>
<li>Parties are now a part of the game. Parties cannot hit each other with basic melee attacks, removing a large part of friendly fire. They can still hit one another with projectiles and autohits.</li>
<li>Parties now share in the Potential gain from killing NPCs. This value is divided by the number of players in the party. Weaker players will get a larger portion than stronger ones. Help your weak friends.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Races</font size>
<li>The variations on Saiyan PotentialRate have been moved back. Originally they ranged from x1.5 to x3. This has been closed to x1 to x2. Those affected by this change will receive a week's worth of RPP for the inconvenience, granted automatically.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<b>03 / 02 / 2020<br>
New Day New Update</b>
<ul>
<font size=+1>AI</font size>
<li>AI will now think to use Wide Wave style autohits.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Races</font size>
<li>Yokai can now have base profiles that actually appear! A change to Spirit Form made it so that they would never display their base profile, only their Spirit Form one.</li>
<li>Saiyans can now get an admin to edit their tail icon as well as their tail wrapped icon. Just in case you don't like brown.</li>
<li>Races that don't need to breathe in space don't care about drowning either.</li>
<li>Shinjin now naturally acquire Grimoire Arcana to prep for future changes to their racial techniques.</li>
<li>Ingenuity Monsters will no longer grow a companion later on in their development. The verb may be repurposed for other uses.</li>
<li>Alien progression has been altered. They now gain ascensions by default (They have 3 of them, with 1 locked behind a condition). Their transformation imparts permanent buffs when it is acquired and first used, but has some functionality that is only used while the transformation is active as well.</li>
<li>Changelings no longer have their Potential gain reduced for the 3 "transformations" that they have unlocked by default.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Skills</font size>
<li>Fusions no longer put you in the void, which should let the passenger be able to hear things...</li>
<li>Unlock Potential has been updated. It now gives you approximately twice the power you had before it was used on you, unlocks an ascension (if possible), and fatigues the user much more.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<b>03 / 01 / 2020<br>
A Bad Touch Beyond A Bad Touch</b>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>Fixed a bug with spawns where it wouldn't let you spawn if someone was sitting on the spawn. Very fun! Welcome, new players. This is the typical DBR experience.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Makyo would bug out their powered form setup if they picked speed.</li>
<li>Made sure that money updates properly after spending it on tech, as well as updating after it is stolen.</li>
</ul>
<b>03 / 01 / 2020<br>
Final Bad Touches</b>
<ul>
<font size=+1>Skills</font size>
<li>Straight Siege had its knockback removed, and gained a limit of 100 blasts similar to Plasma Gatling.</li>
<li>Crash Burst has improved accuracy by x2 as well as gaining x2 more blasts, while lowering the damage of each individual blast by half. This is to give it some utility as a debuff-stacker and differentiate it from Spirit Ball.</li>
<li>Flare Wave damage decreased from 2.5 to 1 while also gaining 2 more shots to manually fire to make it distinct as a blast skill rather than a charge skill.</li>
<li>Stone Skin line has been changed from Pure magic class to Earth magic class, giving Earth specialists a skill that is in their class at all.</li>
<li>Golem Form now adds sweeping strikes.</li>
<li>Flare gains GuardBreak property. In addition, it now properly destroys things by ignoring 66% of endurance of its targets.</li>
<li>Magic attacks in T4 have been standardized to have a 10/15/20 mana cost. Meanwhile, Magic buffs in T4 are now 20/30/40 mana cost.</li>
<li>Magic buffs in T3 have a standardized mana cost of 10/20/30.</li>
<li>Magic attacks in T2 have a standardized mana cost of 10/20/30.</li>
<li>Magic buffs in T1 have a standardized mana cost of 5/10/15.</li>
<li>Overhead Divide has been moved to be a part of Tipper's line. No other changes made.</li>
<li>Cross Slash has been moved to be a part of Arc Slash's line. It gains 1 controlled tile of rush, had its energy cost moved to 3, and caught a 0.5 damage buff. It's still a very awkward skill.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Mapping</font size>
<li>Mappers can now toggle Binoculars without the object.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Signature</font size>
<li>Fixed bug that allowed double tapping of signature obtains.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Saga</font size>
<li>Tapped Saga skills to fall in line with new signature standardization.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Knowledge</font size>
<li>Overdrive now properly impacts Power Up percent.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Races</font size>
<li>Changelings no longer lose BP from unmastered forms.</li>
<li>Changeling, Dragon, Demon, Majin, and Makai Shinjin now get their potential set to the amount of days the wipe has been going on for. They do not gain a backlog of potential that can easily be gained.</li>
<li>Kai Shinjin now get to pick their initial stance from their style.</li>
<br><br>
</ul>
<b>02 / 28 / 2020<br>
Fake Sound of Progress</b>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>The prompt that appears when you attempt to overwrite a new character will note which character is associated with the key. Ostensibly this will prevent people from making over key characters.</li>
<li>Spawns now have learning rates, economy mults, intelligence, and enchantment values associated with them that are added into a race's default values.</li>
<li>The ages selectable for new characters are now Youth and Elder, as opposed to Youth and Child. Children can only be made via harmonious consentual union in the missionary position between opposite sexes.</li>
<li>Rewards are now automated and will happen every 24 hours, counting from when the server perceives midnight to be. Multiple days of rewards will be accounted for.</li>
<li>The amount of potential that one can gain from fighting AI opponents has a cumulative daily limit. Exceeding this limit results in diminished gains which are alleviated depending on how long the wipe has run.</li>
<li>Base mod has been removed as a primary source of BP. Instead, BP is determined by the fighting Potential a character has realized, which is scaled throughout the wipe.</li>
<li>Ascension-based races unlock ascensions at Potential 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90. These ascensions do not carry a power boost anymore.</li>
<li>Zanzoken, Sense, Power Control now are obtained over the course of cultivating your fighting potential. They do not need to be purchased with RPP.</li>
<li>A choice is made at a certain level of potential to select Ki Blade, Ki Shield, or Ki Armor. These skills do not cost RPP to obtain, and you can usually only obtain one.</li>
<li>Skill Tree 'upgrades' on base skills now replace the base skill, cutting down number of verbs by nearly half.</li>
<li>In case of above, some magic skills gained additional functionality that would have been erased; generally speaking an upgrade really is an upgrade.</li>
<li>Voids no longer announce that you are voiding. You must wait out the void timer to learn if you died or not.</li>
<li>Event credit has been changed so that one credit will provide bonus RPP during daily checks for 7 daily checks. Up to 7 'charges' can be stored, and excess charges will be converted into economy charges.</li>
<li>Every race that focuses on ascensions now has 5 ascensions.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Optimization</font size>
<li>Lists of objects containing verbs are now filed away separately; the game only needs to look through 'Buffs' instead of through all of a person's contents to find what buffs are on, for example.</li>
<li>Lists of items are distinct from a mob's contents, which allows for some shorter checks as well.</li>
<li>Fixed up creation code a bit.</li>
<li>Teleport moves now have a framework.</li>
<li>Grapple moves now have a framework.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Skills</font size><br>
<li>The Skill Tree was overhauled. T1 techniques now cost 40 RPP, Tier 2 techniques now cost 80, Tier 3 techniques now cost 120, Tier 4 techniques now cost 160. Upgrades do not scale up this cost.</li>
<li>Styles have standardized costs as well. Skill tree styles cost 20 to gain as well as advance in mastery. The cost associated with Tier 1 Signature Styles is 40. Tier 2 Signature Styles is 80. Tier 3 Signature Styles is 160.</li>
<li>Having a fully mastered style (Mastery 4) allows you to build up Tension which will be displayed in the top left corner. Building a full meter of tension by fighting and then pressing Heavy Strike will unleash a style-dependent finisher, which will also trigger a buff for a short while.</li>
<li>Having an active style will also display your zanzoken charges in the bottom left corner. It only appears there when using a style because I don't like it just sitting there all alone. Looks cluttered.</li>
<li>New T3 Special Slotter: <b>Ghost Install</b>. It adds double-strike (or even triple strike) at the cost of your existing mana, while allowing you to build it back up over the duration. It is best suited to one-on-one fights.</li>
<li>Soul Illusion and Phantom Array styles have been removed. Dual Wield and Triple Wield still exist as styles, increasing the difference between unarmed and armed martial arts.</li>
<li>Martial Styles (any unarmed-only style that is not mystical in nature) now enjoy greater boons and reduced banes from using stances.</li>
<li>All styles have a unified total stat boost, regardless of if they are martial, mystical, universal or armed.</li>
<li>Style Complexity has been removed and no longer increases the stat boosts of a style.</li>
<li>'Basic' Stance no longer exists. Buying a style allows you to obtain one stance essentially for free, and setting a style will automatically set a stance as well with priority on Advancing -> Striking -> Defensive -> Evasive. You can always use a \n macro to immediately set a different stance. (e.g. Turtle-Style\nEvasive-Stance)</li>
<li>Magical Styles now act as spell focii for their related element classes.</li>
<li>The style list has been significantly slimmed down to account for the new Style Development system.</li>
<li>Jinchuuriki now has 4 classes instead of 9 - Tyrant, Catastrophe, Dominator and Juggernaut. Each focuses on a single stat to emphasize differences with Vaizard Mask which boosts at least two.</li>
<li>Jagan Eye now has a prototype for its final tier special, and also offers higher strength and force boons in exchange for taking away endurance.</li>
<li>Shunkan Ido and Blink used to be capable of teleporting while launching a beam. Now, only Shunkan Ido can teleport while CHARGING a beam, and Blink can only be used when not charging or firing.</li>
<li>Ultra Instinct is no longer a style, and is instead a T4 Special Slot buff.</li>
<li>Skills can now act as Spell Focuses.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Sagas</font size>
<li>Sagas that provide stat boosts to a character directly now do this across the whole Saga, rather than just at specific levels..</li>
<li>Sagas must have the SAGA INVEST option in the Skill Tree used to acquire an automated level up, as well as have the character fulfill a Potential threshold. Only levels T2-T6 can be obtained in this method.</li>
<li>Saga T7 and T8 can only be obtained via admin approval.</li>
<li>Admins can still flag a person individually to receive a Saga Tier up, which ignores all requirements.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Signatures</font size>
<li>Signatures are obtained every Potential evenly divisible by 10, with 200 additional RPP (spent or unspent) needed to acquire it. Event Credit does not count towards this RPP threshold.</li>
<li>Style Signatures, which can only be obtained by mastering two styles of the same tier, are obtained at Potential 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, and 65. Potential 65 is a Tier 3 Signature Style, Potentials 25 and 55 are Tier 2 Signature Styles, and the rest are Tier 1. Each follows the same 200 RPP threshold scheme as above.</li>
<li>Special Slot Signatures are obtained at 75 Potential and 1500 RPP.</li>
<li>All of the above are thresholds; if you have apped and approved a relevant skill beforehand, you will not obtain another one once passing the threshold.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Races</font size>
<li>Dragons: now enjoy increased boons and reduced banes when using stances. This stacks with the benefit received by martial styles and some other unique styles. Each also contains small amounts of God Ki.</li>
<li>Yokai: Yokai are now more powerful in their Elder stage. Like fine wine, they ripen with time.</li>
<li>Shinjin: now only have one ascension, which is Ma/Kaioshin tier. They start with their elemental techniques (if Kai), removing the necessity for development in characters that operate best while out of the limelight.</li>
<li>Aliens: have a new racial that can only be chosen at creation to opt to be Spiritual, which increases their imagination. As well as making them spiritual. Obviously.</li>
<li>Also Aliens: Prodigy has been changed so that it doubles the rate that potential is gained, rather than increasing RPP amounts.</li>
<li>Monsters: now choose all of their ascension choices at creation rather than throughout their lifespan. They gain bits and pieces from each option on every ascension, with some capstones acquired only at ascension 3 or 5.</li>
<li>Saiyans: Elite class is no longer a class choice. Instead, every saiyan picks between being Observant or Talented. Talented will immediately reward the saiyan with more Potential, but they gain potential slower. Observant saiyans will start with Potential similar to any other race, but they gain it much faster.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Knowledge</font size>
<li>Ships now announce to the Z plane they are leaving from that they are leaving.</li>
<li>Technology and Enchantment have been dummy proofed from accidental clicking by giving a pop up which allows you to choose to buy an item or examine it. Report any items missing a description.</li>
<li>Knowledge costs have been standardized, with entry level knowledge costing 40 / relevant modifiers, and advanced level knowledge costing 80 / relevant modifiers.</li>

Troublesomer findings.</b><br>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>Tightened checks on Extend passive.</li>
<li>Deleted all pregenerated pocket dimension exits from the standard map so they should stop stacking on oneanother, allowing us to possibly fix pocket dimension more permamently for the wipe.</li>
<li>Implemented mechanics that handle dead people aging.</li>
<li>Readded the Keep Body skill to handle application of forced reincarnation upon era passage when the Underworld entry point becomes more structured.</li>
<li>Certain things cause people to be exempt from the standard reincarnation cycles (high tiers of Sharingan in relation to planned Rinegan implementation, Eight Sense, God Ki, Holy Powered individuals); will open suggestion later to scout out for more conditions, but they'll remain rare.</li>
<li>Corrected the dual check on swimming exhaustion, making sure that oxygen is the actual identifier - it appears that swim was still working off the old setup while space drain was correct.</li>
<li>Oxygen no longer goes below 0; suffocation effects happen when it hits below 10.</li>
<li>In clear imitation of our betters we tied global messages to the Discord channel automatically.</li>
<br><br>

<li>Giant Monsters: Reworked first ascension slightly to be more in line with the other monster types level of strength.</li>

<li>Mutagens: effect scale adjusted, duration upped.</li>
<li>Android Upgrade: lower pricing on first level but later levels scaling similarly to sword reinforcement.</li>
<li>Mecha: Lot of small adjustments to power calculation, ignoring a lot of physical traits of the pilot.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Saga</font size>
<li>Eight Gates: Possibly corrected a rare issue that could occur upon KO with Gates active.</li>

<li>Reversal passive no longer capable of reflecting attacks noted as special (so spells, various explosions etc.).</li>
<li>Functional change to Beams 1 - projectile speed aligned with normal ones.</li>
<li>Functional change to Beams 2 - dashing in/away with a beam charge causes a smaller movement but automatically discharges the beam at the end of it.</li>
<li>Moving Charge granting styles increase the distance traveled in case 2.</li>
<li>Functional change 2 also affects other charging Ki attacks, but without the addition of automatic discharge which is still time gated.</li>

<font size=+1>Skills</font size>
<li>Magic: Timers/Countdowns for a decent number of spells fiddled around with; starting to work towards more consistent timer/cooldown setup across the skill tree.</li>

<li>Kikoho / Shin Kikoho: Damage increased again.</li>

<li>Cosmo: Seventh Sense no longer triggers if user isn't fighting seriously.</li>

<li>Senjutsu: Sage Mode now provides the endless mana trait so casting in it does not drain, but in turn Mana Leak mechanics that makes drain upon dealing/receiving damage ignore endless settings; this in in-advance of a more complex mechanics that'd improve spells used in Sage Mode since in current version the extra mana was never worth using on actual magic as you were directly trading off stats.</li>

<li>Others' thoughts no longer can be heard without Telepathy.</li>
<li>All racial transformations provide a generic upscale in movement and attack speed along with more Flicker charges, compared to more varied effects of Ascensions.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Races</font size>
<li>Expanded racial mechanics and continued reworks!</li>
<li>Starting racial mods adjusted in values.</li>
<li>Aliens inherit the Beastman stat ascensions now, allowing them to more flexibly adjust their build as their progress through ascensions. Ascensions themselves also slightly buffed.</li>
<li>Aliens now permanently improve their focused stats for transformations 2 and beyond.</li>
<li>Aliens gain an extra ascension. After it... it's over.</li>

<li>New and reworked skills!</li>
<li>A larger number of Utility skills and skill functions assigned to the Utility tab.</li>
<li>Flicker charges are now shared between Zanzoken offense and defense.</li>
<li>Autoanger skills now will now trigger the Anger cooldown when ending, meaning normal anger won't be triggered in the duration. Autoanger can still be forced though (meaning Vaizard don't have to suffer a super extended vulnerability window... but it's still present).</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Knowledge</font size>
<li>New breakthroughs for every single branch of knowledge!</li>
<li>Resource Spots are now pretty much eternal. This also makes having control over them more significant. In turn, extraction time has been lengthened.</li>
<li>Clicking an uncovered Resource Spot now gives you an option to scavenge it, lowering its value permanently but providing some immediate resource grab.</li>
<li>Doors are now part of the tech tab; when made, they can be moved around, the password being set when bolted in desired place.</li>
<li>Legendary items can no longer be upgraded, regardless of your enhancer level.</li>

Exhausting.</b><br>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>Desperation get-up proc chance notably lowered for a strongly magnified effect, similar to hellspawn variable.</li>
<li>Items in inventory/put down on the ground will show their 'Inventory' icon state if they have one.</li>
<li>Game now has more specific ways of telling if someone's fighting seriously (wound/lethal intent declared, using a sharp sword, having cursed wounds active) and triggers specific effects like get-ups only when one (or either) side is fighting in that manner.</li>
<li>It also means that unless at least one of the side is fighting with intent to injure, your passives depending on the seriousness combat will not activate; do not come screeeing that shit isn't popping off like it used to.</li>
<li>Death Regeneration now nigh impossible to break but every time the regenerator is killed, it takes more and more for them to come back.</li>

<li>Graphical and typo fixes.</li>
<li>Hitrate should remain same when powered down, which gives it additional role in concealing your power and mid-combat recovery.</li>
<li>Remaining in powered state a bit more exhausting except for Makyojins who now get it for free.</li>
<li>Bokkens no longer have the class upgrade option on them because somehow people don't see the disconnect between 'basic weapon styles' and 'Kendo'.</li>

<b>11/03/2018<br>
KKTs' definition of off days.</b><br>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>Adjustments in sword/staff calcs, especially in context of upgrades.</li>
<li>Small changes for the basis of said calcs as whole.</li>
<li>Likewise changes for staves and armor.</li>
<li>Longer windup for autohits is now included in basic movement requirements; no more porting SEWs, sadly.</li>
<li>For clarity, references to health percentage wounds are being replaced by 'injury', while 'wounds' will refer solely to the BP affecting conditions.</li>
<li>Shearing now prevents Regeneration from healing wounds and regrowing limbs.</li>
<li>Fancier animation for Afterimage Strikes if both parties have it set, Afterimage Strikes now always knockback which improves their 'get off me' function, you can only have one AIS stack at once now, but the CD is structured similary to Zanzoken.</li>
<li>Afterimage Strike properly ends stuns.</li>
<li>Animal traits now retain proper colors.</li>
<li>Following up after a Zanzoken combo now actually requires you to be out of your attack cooldown; Zanzoken attacks still have a slightly smaller attack cooldown.</li>
<li>Transformations without default auras should now use your default Power Up Aura in absence of a specific one set.</li>
<li>Androids and mechanized folks (anyone whose Mana displays as Battery) can not be healed by magic targetting them nor by Purity effects.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Races</font size>
<li>Lots of Namekian reworks.</li>
<li>Warrior Nameks remain generally the same, inherit Dragon Namekian speed ascensions and get a little more powerful.</li>
<li>They also start out with Antenna Beam and Equipment Materialization, so they can branch out into sword techniques early, use armor to cover up for weaker defenses and produce training weights.</li>
<li>Dragon Namekians can branch out into Healer, Enchanter and Heretic at creation.</li>
<li><b>Healer</b> path grants Heal along with a give power packet (Give Power, Transfer Energy) at first ascension level.</li>
<li><b>Enchanter</b> provides extra capacity at creation and the usual Grimoire Arcana access at first ascension level.</li>
<li><b>Heretic</b> grants boosted Anger, Antenna Beam and Giant Form at first ascension.</li>
<li>All Dragon Namek first ascensions are White Ascension level; Warriors remain as usual.</li>
<li>Namekian Fusion fuses relevant passives from the Dragon Class.</li>
<li>Majority of Namekian power is now frontloaded in their Ascensions; Super Namekian levels are unlocked through fusing and provide extra stats, faster activation of Powered State and calm anger effect.</li>
<li>Changelings can now properly choose their Final Form upgrades at first Ascension.</li>
<li>Androids lose a bit of intelligence but gain a massive boost in learning ability (equal to human now); this is to align the upcoming changes to tech-ascension humans.</li>
<li>Android pure BP on creation scaled waaaaay down in relation to the above change.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Skills</font size>
<li>Damage ceilings for Opener, Finisher and Decider traits buffed back a little.</li>
<li>Likewise for Determinator trait.</li>
<li>Light Rush now produces less projectiles but they're stronger.</li>
<li>Heal skill now nullifies your Shear stacks.</li>
<li>Heal no longer taxes regeneration but actually checks for your energy now, while also having really high energy cost.</li>
<li>Heal has an actual Cooldown now.</li>
<li>High Imagination healers receive less backlash from using Heal.</li>
<li>High Imagination healers patch up wounds immediatelly.</li>
<li>Materialize Equipment loses the ability to make staves but can create (crappy) armor now, weights and most importantly, grants access to Clothes Beam.</li>
<li>Clothes Beam allows you to create and automatically equip a piece of clothing to someone you are facing.</li>
<li>Creating weights with Materialize carries a relatively hefty capacity cost.</li>
<li>Blazing Storm isn't a launcher anymore.</li>
<li>Giant Form spell should now replace itself by the new Golem Form spell, which makes you larger, more intimidating and harder to hurt at the cost of completely taking away your magic ability in the duration.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Knowledge</font size>
<li>In-advance changes to Summoning and Armament Enchant trees; please report directly to KKT for adjustements.</li>
<li>Weapon Enchanters can now magnify the traits of the weapon class they're ascending, which allows you to retain the passives related to one of the basic weapon styles (Iaido, Zornhau, Fencing) when using a different style.</li>
<li>Innately greater magical capacity decreases effective capacity costs; artifically increased capacity won't replicate this functionality.</li>
<li>At least one level of Tool Enchantment knowledge is required to use a Crystal Ball.</li>
</ul>

<li>Slayer Mod reworked from targeting humanlike races to targetting races with more or less standard biology.</li>
<li>Recovery effect on cooldowns and chargeup times reduced/bounded.</li>
<li>Intimidation effect on deflection reduced/bounded.</li>
<li>Mortal wounds now tint your screen. Things that heal them + relogging untint it in case it was stuck.</li>
<li>Targetting someone gives more information on their health status.</li>
<li>Flying/Skimming now grant a default movement speed, disconnected from other factors, with exception of Crippling and Attraction; Skimming is slower.</li>
<li>Successfully reverse-dashing out of a launcher now gives you a stability charge that protects you from the next one.</li>
<li>Juggernauts gain twice the stability charges of anyone else; in exchange, they lose their stun resistance.</li>
<li>Shield should be more reliable when it comes to damage reduction from projectiles.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Races</font size>
<li>More intimidating monsters.</li>
<li>Certain races (Namekians, Changelings, Dragons), classes (Eldritch), racials (Xenobiology) and Awakenings (Zombie) move your anatomy just far enough from usual biology that both techniques specifically designed to kill organic and critical hits just aren't effective against you.</li>
<li>New racial pick for aliens: <b>Xenobiology</b> - it alters your anatomy to the point where attacks specially effective against living beings lose their extra damage.</li>
<li>New racial pick for aliens: <b>Longevity</b> - doubles the duration of every life stage.</li>

<li>New T1 Unarmed Skill: <b>Volleyball Fist</b> - a combination of three attacks with different properties, becoming more powerful if you manage to chain them together.</li>
<li>New T1 Sword Skill: <b>Slam Wave</b> - leap high in the air and fall down, driving your weapon into the ground; range and shockwave size scale with sword damage.</li>
<li>New T2 Sword Skill: <b>Zantetsuken</b> - a single slash in the blink of an eye, with chance of inflicting mortal damage if it connects; fairly lengthy wind-up.</li>
<li>New T3 Slotless Buff: <b>Sparking Blast</b> - unleash a burst of energy that intensely revitalizes you while maximing your damage scaling and mobility in the duration.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Knowledge</font size>
<li>More buff grimoires now return to occupying Special slot.</li>
<li>Blood Grimoire now disables after a short timer, meant majorly to be used in advance of powerful spells being cast. Moderate cooldown.</li>

<li>Resistance was removed as a stat.  Yes, really.</li>
<li>Mods were lowered across the board, even if this results in practically no change, relatively speaking.</li>
<li>Majin (the race) is now referred to as Majin.</li>
<li>Agorothians are asplode.</li>

<li>Transformation boosts can once again be seen on the stat panel.  The numbers are smaller.</li>
<li>Style and stance texts cannot be customized.  Because they're martial arts.</li>
<li>Saiyan 'Zenkai' Tier S has been refashioned into Ascensions as there was no particular reason to not do so.</li>

<li>Graphical tweaks.</li>
<li>Autohits don't go as cray with rolls anymore, but they still get less whiffy with damage mod.</li>
<li>RP Mode now stops Powering Down from taking away PU%, making reverting under it less of a hassle.</li>
<li>Game skin modified to allow 64x64 mode.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Races</font size>

Weighting the options.</b><br>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>Damage roll variance increased slightly, removed the slight native damage reduction that was in the code so we might have higher melee/autohit damage for a while.</li>
<li>When it comes to 'blocking' autohits, their accuracy multiplier when deciding on them whiffing is now equal to their damage multiplier.</li>
<li>Fusions now include the boons of unlocked potential.</li>
<li>In preparation for future changes, using Zanzoken now -always- triggers an attack. This means fights will probably get a bit more... flighty.</li>
<li>The above means that previous change to Launcher type attacks no longer matters.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Knowledge</font size>
<li>Science people can now produce actual Scissor Blades in communication with admin staff.</li>
<li>Scissor Blades have slightly weaker shearing capabilities than Dainsleif and come in with a Decapitation Mode skill that changes their class and reach.</li>

<li>Massively lower chance of KB from normal attacks to prevent KB loops. In turn, lower CD on basic Heavy Strike and Dragon Dash which are consistent source of knockback.</li>

</ul>
<b>6/9/2018<br>
Mature update for mature people.</b><br>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>Darkness Flame now pierces through normal debuff immunity so specific resistance sources like sealed suits and being from fire-resistant race work bit better against it.</li>
<li>A mirror passive added in Absolute Zero, which affects Water-type attacks, inflicting Chill, Shock and Shatter, even through debuff immunity.</li>
<li>Being debuff-immune still makes these qualities fade out faster.</li>
<li>Meditation no longer instantly heals away all shearing, but notably speeds up its recovery.</li>
<li>Small corrections to how undense turfs/objects interact with normal melee. Should fix issues Ray Gear had on underwater missions.</li>
<li>The above corrections will also make the delay increases through melee-replace attacks actually matter.</li>
<li>Super holy things (good Shinjin, Masamune Oversoul) can inflict 'holy' type damage even on neutral beings.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Races</font size>
<li>Android interactions PU spikes (in absence of Fusion Core) corrected. Making up for some lost options, an extra ascension. Please report to admin for adjustments regarding the former.</li>
<li>Endgame Makyos even ogrier.</li>
<li>Fusions should be capable of going SS4 now. Both parties need to be capable of entering it as a requirement.</li>
<li>Transformed Agorothians notably mightier.
<li>Final Ascension Tuffles gain an even higher cyberization multiplier.</li>
<li>The Offense/Defense buff moved an ascension earlier.</li>
<li>Half Saiyans now have access to Super Saiyan Rage (bleh), which is an odd in-between state of Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan Two.</li>

<li>Multiple Oversoul modifications.</li>

<li>New T3 Sword Style: <b>Sword and Board</b> - a defensive style that pairs up your trusty weapon with an even more trusty shield, providing a variety of strong defensive bonuses.</li>

<li>Fixed the bugs with Androids being unable to properly install Reparative Nanobots.</li>
<li>Fixed Androids clearing out their additional over-the-limit stat mods.</li>
<li>Fixed the Give Power bug. No Broly.</li>
<li>Fixed Chakra Freeze not clearing off for people otherwise immune to elemental and crippling-related debuffs.</li>
<li>Increased the impact of buff strains on energy usage a little bit.</li>
<li>Poison offset now scales better with improving regeneration mod. Also, poison requires more stacks to hit its current damage cap.</li>
<li>Chaos Elemental Defense Added. Void Elemental Offense now has innate damage mult.</li>
<li>Transformation strains for SSJ forms should now work properly. Also, differences between different masteries of SSJ should be more notable.</li>
<br><br>

<li>Makai denizens now all get access to Maki (formerly: Majin). It serves purely as auto-anger and cursed wound trigger right now and carries no other boosts.</li>
<li>Half-Demon hairs no longer affected by their transformation being unlocked. Also, setting hair for the transformation should work now, but mind - no default ones.</li>
<li>Heran ascensions now overall slightly stronger than standard Aliens due to lack of specialization and less safety wheels in form of trans moments.</li>
<li>Nobody will play them cause they're gingers anyway.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Skills</font size>
<li>Small Ray buff since it was generally worse than T1 Beam sides ease of deployment.</li>
<li>Sweeping Beam icon issues fixed.</li>
<li>Poison Gas now innatelly deals some damage to accomodate for the debuff nerf.</li>
<br><br>

<li>Modified the boosts granted by Chain Grimoire contracts to be more sensible. There's also a small debuff that's associated with being contracted but it's only functional when your contract power gets siphoned into another person.</li>
<li>Silver weaponry effectivness boosted - damage from it is considered 'pure' against evil (and thus dealing 100% damage as injuries).</li>
<li>Evil beings with really high unholy affinity (represented by Abyss Mod) and various Tier S pinging as evil that gain such mod can use it to partly resist silver damage (but not true 'pure' damage).</li>

<li>New passive: <b>Technique Mastery</b> - a scaling reduction on skill cooldown; currently kept to low levels for testing purposes.</li>
<li>New passive: <b>Movement Mastery</b> - a scaling trait which decides how much power any given PU% translates to.</li>
<li>Above added to plainer T3 styles (Yin Yang and Spirit Style), which didn't really provide T3 utilities.</li>

<li>Costs of upgrading android cyber power should no longer display odd values.</li>
<li>Costs of various android upgrades are higher than similar costs for cyberize due to amount of resources they can easily produce.</li>
<li>As a boon, Androids now begin with 10 stat modules slot, the same amount as fully ascended Tuffle.</li>

If I Had A Life Right Now, I'd Be Living It.</b>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>Various icon and logic fixes. Nothing interesting or worth hyping but I did say every update will have a changelog.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<b>11/27/2017<br>
Guns Are Gay. We Are Gay. We = Guns???</b>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>You should no longer appear as weaker/stronger than yourself when sensing.</li>
<li>Also, range increased. I think. There's like three different but same-named variables governing this shit???</li>
<li>You should no longer be able to throw people 0 tiles.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Skills</font size>
<li>Aerial Recovery and Payback now all properly obey their cooldowns. Cooldowns lenghtened to make combos a little more possible.</li>
<li>Suplex and Izuna Drop minor bugs corrected.</li>
<li>Dominator/Determinator should no longer have peak damage mods of over 3 trillion. This is not a hyperbole.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Technology</font size>
<li>Suddenly: Gear!  Incinerators, Power Claws, Pile Bunkers, Missile Swarms, Plasma Gatlings, Jet Boots, Environment Suits have all been added.  Try them out in a live-fire experiment today!!</li>
<li>Additionally, Powered Armor and its Mark 2 versions were added as full Buff options to the Gear toolbox. They occupy the main buff slot and the base version acts as an Armor-type buff.</li>
<li>Also, Cyberize has a new mod: Combat CPU.  It helps you see why kids love cinnamon toast crunch, or something.  It takes up one of the slotless...slots...for cyberize enhancements.</li>
</ul>

Skill Tree Not So Skillful After Getting Bullied</b>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>Skill Points for smarty/unsmarty races now should round off nicely. Say bye to your odd halves and .3333...(s)</li>
<li>New Queued move trait: <b>Counter</b> - when queued, they will react to opponent's normal attacks and dodge it similarly to AIS/WS, while launching their own strike.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Skills</font size>
<li>Couple (read: a lot) of fixes to various unpickable Skill Tree objects. There are still some bugs with locks/unlocks that Jinxu is currently working his hardest on.</li>
<li>Soft taps on some damage outputs and cooldowns.</li>
<li>Due to buffs to Elements and Elemental Punches, the previously approved of exploit of combining them with autohits was corrected.</li>
<li>Animation upgrades.</li>

This Kills The Dog</b>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>Broken swords can now be dropped without issues.</li>
<li>Launcher freeze length adjusted. Also, it can be gotten out of with Reverse Dash - please remember that, might save your life.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Races</font size>
<li>The scourge of KKT math had befallen Misshape. The results it provides will be patently less impressive, at least at low ascension levels.</li>
<li>On the other hand, it should bug out notably less.</li>
<li>Bestial instincts are not a thing. No. Not at all.</li>
</ul>

<li>Observe lets you observe people, instead of just the void.  <font color='black'>Hello darkness my old friend...</font color></li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Races</font size>
<li>Chimera's racial unique, Misshape, was computed to make retarded numbers.  <b>On purpose.</b>  But now it doesn't.  So, that's kind of a nerf.</li>
<li>It also slightly adjusts icon coloration, as it was supposed to.</li>
<li>Regenerate now heals again.<li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<b>9/12/2017-11/16/2017<br>
Autism Is Not A Limited Resource Edition</b>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>After sincere consideration, anger mods have been scaled back.  With few notably angry exceptions, the maximum NATURAL anger mod is now 200%.</li>
<li>Base movement speed raised slightly, diminishing returns on Speed and Godspeed affecting movement speed - less headless chickens running about.</li>
<li>Slight UI updates for pretty much everything.</li>
<li>You can now adjust the color of your animal traits separately from your hair.</li>
<li>Reduced message spam on multi-hit elemental attacks.</li>
<li>Grab bug should no longer happen. On the other hand, Grab now stops moving in a direction so please be mindful of how you use it.</li>
<li>Skills that normally only healed health/energy will now heal wounds and fatigue if you hit your current cap on the former - obviously, much slower.</li>
<li>New status effect added: <b>Sheared</b> - stops any life recovery and only heals up (relatively quickly) while meditating. Inflicted by Scissor Blades and a handful of other things.</li>
<li>New status effect added: <b>Crippled</b> - doubles movement delay for the duration; inflicted by variety of melee moves.</li>
<li>Divinity passive effects replaced by Ki Control. It no longer increases the speed of powering up, but rather improves its handling. Thus, drain get slower the closer the user is to draining out and they can power down much faster - allowing for greater energy management.</li>
<li>Divinity now notably rarer and handled by possession of the God Ki Mastery.</li>
<li>Visible BP is now slightly variable on per-character basis. It means that it's no longer as easy to tell if someone's is of particular race or injury level simply by seeing their BP value.</li>
<li>Think display range lowered.</li>
<li>Reading thoughts now comes in pack with telepathy, rather than divinity. It has a more restricted range though.</li>
<li>Temporary return to high damage DBR as we're buffing up a lot of signature and skill tree moves damage output in comparision to more consistent power offered by various buffs.</li>
<li>Flicker no longer provides automatic combos.</li>
<li>Juggernaut no longer provides complete stun immunity.</li>
<li>Adrenaline movement speed upgrade caps out now.</li>
<li>The Siphon trait (like the one Aphotic Shield holds) can now drain energy from Ki-imbued melee attacks.</li>
<li>Opener, Decider and Finisher effects made more meaningful, so it is more worth to keep them for the right moment rather than spam all your queues whenever available.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Races</font size>
<li>After suffering from not being reworked for like an entire wipe, Humans have once again been overhauled.  The infinity gimmick is gone and now they have four ascensions.  High Tension has 4 levels in 25% increments, though you only need a single level unlocked to use all four.</li>
<li>Tuffles slightly worse at learning magic than tech.</li>
<li>Dragon Namekians slightly better at learning magic.</li>
<li>New Alien racial: Venomblood - grants improved poison resistance and can apply poison onto attacker when wounded.</li>
<li>Genius Aliens learn a bit faster in general (bonus RPP gain).</li>
<li>Hunter Aliens now have more keen sense of smell.</li>
<li>Overall, Aliens slightly buffed as a base, due to nerfs on their best passives.</li>
<li>Alien transformation auto-unlock moved to same period as Demi and Namekian first ascension.</li>
<li>Changelings begin with a little less power but their hardened body posses an additional layer of protection that exists as bonus health. Be aware that transforming into higher forms sheds parts of it.</li>
<li>Changelings can now access a One Hundred Percent Power form in their third transformation. Appable after first ascension.</li>
<li>Non-Kaioshin Shinjin no longer innately divine in accordance with the source.</li>
<li>Demigod God-Mode now accessed through the God Ki buff.</li>
<li>Monsters have been reworked considerably.  There is a new class, Beastmen, which uses the stat ascension mechanic all monsters used to have.  Chaos monsters have been reworked into Chimeras, and Boundless have become Wraiths.  One is suited to shifting their body about to approximately mimic their targets, while the other has maintained survivability and all-terrain features, now with an Eldritch flavor.  Devourers are stronger, but mostly the same.</li>
<li>Majins have Super Buu and Kid Buu ascensions.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Stances</font size>
<li>Living Weapon was converted into a stance. This opens the style slot which allows it to be competitive with Champloo and its sword upgrades.</li>
<li>Strong Fist / Strongest Fist now carry the qualities of shattering and weapon breaking.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Styles</font size>
<li>Slight buffs to Elemental Styles.</li>
<li>Higher levels of Weapon Breaker act both in offense and in defense.</li>
<li>Yin Yang Style now behaves as low level Weapon Breaker when targetting a sword user.</li>
<li>Moonlight Style now offers a damage reduction based on Resistance, in opposite to Sunlight stance.</li>
<li>Dual Wield and Trinity Style now calculate melee attacks with the second and third blade you wield.</li>
<li>Champloo Kendo had some logical errors addressed.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Buffs</font size>
<li>Small boosts to Limit Breaker to make it slightly better as alternative to Trance Form.</li>
<li>Regeneration works slower but over longer period. Overall the health healed is the same, but it's easier to outpace damage wise.</li>
<li>Fixed the bug where Regeneration allowed you to regenerate limbs and wounds even without the energy necessary to use it.</li>
<li>Hunter Alien Invisibility renamed to Camouflage, it has a three minute time limit and requires you to be greatly powered down before and during usage. Broken by speaking.</li>
<li>Kaioken now has only 6 mastery levels so you can max it out notably faster. It's upper power cap was lowered slightly.</li>
<li>Small boosts to Limit Breaker to make it slightly better as alternative to Trance Form.</li>
<li>Broken Phantasm no longer completely destroys non-conjured swords; in relation, the buff provided was reduced along with the mana cost.</li>
<li>Broken Phantasm now ends in a damaging explosion.</li>
<li>Bonuses from Reinforcement now consolidated into upgrading the sword's ascension level. Just like sword themselves, the total level caps out at 4, so there's no point in reinforcing Ascension 4 weapons.</li>
<li>Badass Bards and Legends can now customize their guitars in similar way Spirit Sword users get to customize theirs.</li>
<li>The MakesSword trait had some logical errors addressed.</li>

<br><br>
<font size=+1>Skills</font size>
<li>Sense now takes the stat average into account when comparing strengths.</li>
<li>Zanzoken can be used twice before going on a cooldown. Flicker passive now directly adds to this value instead of affecting the CD.</li>
<li>Zanzoken automatically goes into an attack if used on opponent in knockback state. Those combo attacks have additional knockback themselves.</li>
<li>The priority on all forms of Absorb has shifted from absorbing a number of people to a higher quality of person.</li>
<li>Burning Finger, Thunder Hands and any other grab moves no longer stack. In return, they received duration and power upgrades.</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Technology</font size>
<li>Gear and Tomes now display the number of charges they hold.</li>
<li>You can increase the number of your Gear slots by fitting them into your cybernetic limbs.</li>
<li>The above means that Androids hold <b>four</b> extra Gear slots by definition.</li>
<li>New Gears. Reworked Tomes.</li>
<li>Weaponized Grimoires: advent of Ars Armagus and Nox Nyctores!  Currently featuring Yukianesa, Bolverk and Ookami!</li>
<li>Philosopher Stones make their debut.  In order to gain the Transmute power which can be used on a knocked out foe, one must possess knowledge of Alchemy and Arcanic Creation.  Those knowledgable of Grimoires can inact an even more potent ritual.</li>
<li>Highly cyberized people and androids do not have their battery capacity accounted for enchanting.</li>
<li>In line with the above, they cannot store their battery capacity in capacitors either.</li>
<li>Due to lowering a lot of anger values, cybernetics now also affect power up rate.</li>
<li>The ability to cyberize others can now be acquired by learning Improved Medical Technology and Physical Enhancement technology knowledges.  Note that this can ONLY be performed on others!</li>
<br><br>
<font size=+1>Tier S</font size>
<li>Kamui has been readded as a Tier S!</li>
<li>Keyblades have been readded as a Tier S!</li>
<li>Weapon Soul and Hiten Mitsurugi practitioners can use half of their Tier S level (rounded up) in place of their sword ascension level (if higher); this applies to everything besides how prone to breakage it is.</li>
<li>Hiten Mitsurugi style now gains higher innate Pursuer passive with every stat ascension. The style itself is focused on God Speed and Flicker passives.</li>
<li>Sharingan can now copy-learn Skill Tree skills. Ability to do depends on tier of the skill and Sharingan in question.</li>
<li>It's now relatively harder to suffer total blindness from Mangekyou Sharingan overuse.</li>
<li>Additional option for Aetherians: Aether Bow - improves their projectile and spell-like abilities instead of melee combat.</l>
<li>Aether Blade mechanics smoothened out and adjusted to working with Autohits (and projectiles in case of Aether Bow).</li>
<li>Eight Gates has been modified somewhat.  Using the Open Gates verb, you may ascend by one Gate each press.  Closing the Gates is handled with the Close Gates verb.  There is a hidden verb for every individual Gate with the syntax "Gate (Number)" where (Number) is replaced with the word of the number (for example, 'Gate-One', 'Gate-Five' and so on).</li>
<li>Weapon Soul has been restructured.  Each of the blades is an actual item now.  Developing a bond with that legendary artifact is what will enable you to walk down the path of the Tier S.</li>

<li>Some trans icon and mechanic tweaks.</li>
<li>Half Demon trans no longer buffs regen considering they got their buffed regen integrated into their base forms. That was an oversight.</li>
<li>Medkit effectivness now scales with the seriousness of injury, so they should be more worthwhile in treating heavy wounds in field.</li>

<font size=+1>Awakenings</font size>
<li>Vamps no longer drain energy (because why), but their Frenzy should now properly scale to their blood drinkings.</li>

<li>Crimson Grimoire: Burning Red now contains a lengthy but finite timer.</li>
<li>Azure/Blue Grimoires rebalanced a bit. They have a lower activation threshold but scale down as they use up mana. Also the overall buffs provided were tweaked to be less heavy.</li>
<li><s>Buffs that create swords should now deactivate all sword-needing buffs as they're turned off. Thanks to Greg for reporting.</s></li>
<li><s>Above fix caused a nasty loop in main slotters which made swords so for now it's replaced with a sanity check.</s></li>

<li>Awakenings will no longer provide signature verbs of their own (as Haki did), instead altering the basic verbs (Heavy Strike, Throw, Grab, Pose, etc.) to use variety of effects.</li>
<li>Presence of awakenings will be strongly considered when it comes to progression speed.</li>

<li>Human stat points reduced from 40 to 30.  Human ascensions were tweaked.</li>
<li>Half Saiyans tweaked as they are common now.  They operate as effective half Saiyans, half humans.  They have two ascensions that are similar in function to humans, and use the same transformation mechanics as saiyans.  Half Saiyans are not eligible for Zenkai Tier S.</li>
<li>Half humans of all types gain 1.25x RPP.</li>
<li>Changelings learn slower due to their high natural power.</li>

<li>After a more fitting introduction, Spiral made reasonable again. To a point.</li>
<li>Additional content. Reworks of some of the signature techniques.</li>

<font size=+1>Debug</font size>
<li>Great Deluge is most likely no longer be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRuVe2voS1U&t=2m02s">this</a>.</li>
<li>Likewise, Super Explosive Wave should no longer be nuclear.</li>
<li>Sokidan and Kienzan is working and probably not making you freeze in place.  Also they (and other projectiles) can't be destroyed by punching them even though that was funny.</li>
<li>Saiyans don't have super frisky tails that pop out when they sense the m o o n.</li>
<li>Scouters are no longer part of Scanner Technology and are part of Advanced Transmission Technology.  This makes them able to be made.</li>
<li><s>Topkek</s> Toppuken now working properly.  This is why you don't rush development.</li>

6/23/2017<br>
Edition We Need To Slow Down<br>
v11.0.2<br>
<br>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>Deity two-way telepaths now protected by higher divinity levels, meaning you can have secret conversations with followers without the mortal being a source of leaks.</li>
<li>Higher Divinities cannot be observed by lower beings.</li>
<li>Queues now can have their text colors set.</li>
<li>Slight Android buff since BlueAkira suggested they may need a nerf.</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Knowledge</font size>
<li>Grimoire Arcana has had additional restrictions put on it.  A single person can only make up to three different types of grimoire.  Each grimoire can only be made a certain number of times by a single person.</li>
<li>For the most part, items made by enchantment had their prices reduced.  Or made less odd.</li>
<li>Ascending weapons now scales in cost.</li>
<li>Rescaling of the prices of some stuff accessible through Cyberize and Grimoire Arcana. At current prices they'd become really easy to get before a lot of folks even have a buff.</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Tier S</font size>
<li>Additional content for couple existing Tier S.</li>
<li>Saiyan Dominance now properly not turning on after anger.</li>
<li>Rescaling of skills providing super armor. Bit less on low health, bit more on high, overall small nerf.</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Buffs</font size>
<li>Some Cyberize buff upgrades in response to the price jumps.</li>
<li>Slightly buffed (?) Oozaru. One of intended functionalities wasn't fully working.</li>
<li>Some additional spice to West and East Kaiou buffs. Their finishers are still in WIP state, but we're working hard.</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Debug</font size>
<li>Every mention of 'feriocity' in the code - corrected.
</ul>
<br><br>

6/20/2017<br>
Edition Remember Version V9.1.2 7/19/2015?<br>
v9.1.2 bis<br>
<br>
<ul>
<font size=+1>General</font size>
<li>Regen Tanks significantly buffed.</li>
<li>Medkits significantly buffed.</li>
<li>All players default to no wound intent. Ish. <:3c</li>
<li>Max duration of AFKTimer tripled to make idle healing a bit more attention-requiring.</li>
<li>Androids now do not use charges on equipped Gear, making it effectively integrated weaponry. More Gear meant specifically for Androids: soon.</li>
<li>Resource spots and engineering making a functional comeback. Hopefully.</li>
<li>Due to community input and Hellz' well-worded analysis, sharp swords now only have a chance to cause wounds modified by their damage multiplier when Wound Intent is off. Credits to Leeroy for idea.</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Tier S</font size>
<li>Unique passive qualities for Zenkai: Zeal followers adapt to their opponent over the course of the fight, Pride's Judgment can discern their enemies' weaker defensive at a glance and Honor grows more defiant when their opponents land strong blows.</li>
<li>Unique active abilities for Zenkai: Zeal's Saiyan Soul which provides a burst of Power Up based on the difference of power between user and opponent, Pride's Saiyan Dominance which allows them to temporarily ignore opponents' durability and Honor's Saiyan Grit lowers their mobility but lets them land powerful counterhits the closer they are to KO.</li>
<li>Other than the above, the Zenkai mostly provides BP increases and less so statistical boons like it did before.
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Buffs</font size>
<li>Some of the Cardinal buffs corrected in their functionality.</li>
<li>Fake Moon deploys a little faster.</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Debug</font size>
<li>The variable oversight that caused the overtly high wound buildup after anger should've been rectified. If wounds above 60-80% still happen to anyone but Humans without trying pretty hard, please report.</li>
<li>Homing projectiles are slightly bugged atm. Steps were taken to deal with that but some of the quirkiness will require more work.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>

6/17/2017<br>
Edition Ubisoft<br>
v11.0.1<br>
<br>
<ul>
<font size=+1>Buffs</font size>
<li>Slight reduction on Kaioken drain. Kaioken now gives a message on what level you're activating.</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Debug</font size>
<li>Resource Spots temporarily disabled.</li>
<li>Playerbase is no longer a cursed hivemind. In-game, at the very least.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>

4/26/2017-6/15/2017<br>
Edition Undecim<br>
v11.0.0<br>
<br>
<ul>
<font size=+1>Creation</font size>
<li>Body sizes were removed!</li>
<li>20 points (40 for Humans, 100 for Aliens/Androids) are offered at character generation for build customization!</li>
<li>Diminishing returns diminish less!  Unless you're an alien or android, in which case they diminish more!</li>
<li>A new stat, 'Capacity' has been made.  It determines the amount of your mana you can utilize; think of it as wounds/fatigue, but for mana.</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Races</font size>
<li>Shinzoku class Monsters were reworked into Minion class monsters.  They start out weak and remain weak...However, they have a great survival rate!!</li>
<li>Shinjin are now finally complete (for reals).  They feature two branches: Makai and Kai.  Kai learn signature skills that can be passed on to worthy students.  Makai learn powerful but common skills and are fit to rule by themselves.</li>
<li>Demigods now start with their divine class unlocked and have higher BP starting out.</li>
<li>Aliens return to having 1.5 BP, though with changes to diminish their cheese potential is notably lower.</li>
<li>A number of Alien perks were consolidated.</li>
<li>Humans were reworked.  Again!  They feature lower stats and higher stat points now.  4 ascensions.  Too many transformations.</li>
<li>Saiyans are common and dare I say good. Maybe. Possibly.</li>
<li>Changelings are now common.  They start with 3 transformations unlocked.  They can acquire 3 ascensions which allow them to use these transformations more effectively.  They are approximately balanced against saiyans.</li>
<li>Androids were changed so that they cannot power up outside of using Overdrive or Fusion Core.  They possess no natural power and are based entirely around cyber BP.</li>
<li>Demons now do cursed wounds all the time forever.  Unholy...</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Tier S</font size>
<li>Tier S now feature 8 levels of progression which allows for more steady advancement as well as greater characterization.</li>
<li>All Stands will give random stats now; the type of stand you choose determines what stats can be randomly assigned.</li>
<li>Ansatsuken now changes your mana into SUPER METER.  It uses this resource when performing special techniques.  Melee combat will build up your SUPER.</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Buffs</font size>
<li>Burst Regeneration and Injury Recovery have been consolidated into a single verb: Regeneration.  It can be flagged to regenerate limbs, but does not by default.</li>
<li>Buffs now have variables to support regeneration of health, energy, mana, wounds, fatigue and capacity.</li>
<li>Earth Fists now has a second stage called Iron Fist.  It buffs you when you are struck with an attack.</li>
<li>Ultimate Super Stances were created; they combine the power boosts of basic buffs with some of the power up versatality of super stances.  And lots of stats.</li>
<li>Champloo Kendo can no longer use a basic stance with a sword; this reduces it to a T2 skill.</li>
<li>Fist of <s>Mortal Flame</s> Darkness Flame, Iron Fist, Vortex Stance, and <s>Zugzwang</s> Thunder Fist can be found on the skill tree.</li>
<li>Circulation Stance and Soul Crushing Stance make a return, this time punching with force versus endurance and strength versus resistance respectively!  They are basic stances and can be applied for.</li>
<li>Stances have been refitted into buff objects.  Toggle Stance will drop any stances you have up when you use it.  There is a hidden verb for each stance/form to quickly equip it if you dislike the prompt box.  The distinction between Stances and Forms is: Forms are applied for, Stances are on the skill tree.  Quickswap verbs would follow the syntax: "Ox-Stance" or "Circulation-Form"</li>
<li>Styles have been given a similar treatment to Stances.</li>
<li>Buffs can now take on their own hair icons. Some existing racial buffs (currently SSJ Grades) use the race's existing transformation hairs.
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Projectiles</font size>
<li>Projectiles can now have custom effects applied to them like pretty much everything else.</li>
<li>Beams work again.  Beam struggles, too.</li>
<li>You can't turn (not even with the FaceDir verbs) while shooting a beam, but you can turn while charging a projectile.</li>
<li>Trying to zanzoken behind an opponent who is beaming will, instead, place you right in front of them.</li>
<li>Beams are not deflectable at the moment of writing but they do proc Wild Sense dodges.</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Passives</font size>
<li>The various Spirit/Ki Blade passives will pass on their damage calculations to autohits unless they're considered a Special Attack.</li>
<li>Elementally attuned characters can enchant a weapon with their element.</li>
<li>Elemental debuffs have a uniform chance of being applied and will always have a small chance of happening.</li>
<li>Poison and fire are harder to resist but do significantly less damage per tick.</li>
<li>The Shocked elemental debuff no longer stuns your character; instead, it reduces offense and defense.</li>
<li>Precision autohits can be dodged by AIS. Area autohits can be partly blocked</li>
<li>Passives have been created to CUT and TAX stats.  A CUT is permanent and will never be removed; a TAX is a temporary reduction of a stat.</li>
<li>Fatigue recovers slower depending on your overall physical condition and Injuries recover much slower in general.  Medics rejoice...</li>
<li>Swords with damage multiplier higher than 1 cut people.  Use a bokken if you want to spar with a sword!</li>
<li>Certain races have custom messages when anger is triggered; these can also be manually set.</li>
<li>There is a new variable, EquipMaster, which starts at 1 and goes up to 8.  You can apply to have this variable increased, which is the only way to increase it.  It represents an enhanced capability to smith swords, staves, and armor (which doesn't do much right now).</li>
<li>Intelligence impacts how much it costs to gain new knowledge and how productive your "time (RPP) to money" conversion rate is.</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Queues</font size>
<li>Sacred Sword and Secret Sword were changed from being autohits to queue techniques.  Now swords have queues!</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Knowledge</font size>
<li>The tech tree has been renamed to the Knowledge Tree, for it now holds both technology and enchantment!</li>
<li>Potions are reintroduced.  Be wary, however: they have consequences associated with their use...</li>
<li>Players can convert RPP into money over time; it's for those times you're really determined to buy that new cyber module.</li>
<li>Buffed Conveyor Belts.</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Aesthetics</font size>
<li>Swords can now apply a hitspark bound to the sword, so instead of slashing someone you could theoretically smash them.  Or stab them.</li>
<li>Using new futuristic technology (read as: the stat panel), one can assess their own state of woundedness!  Approximately.</li>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>Debug</font size>
<li>Passives were given a more robust framework so as to not glitch out when provided from multiple sources.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>

4/11/2017 10.1.3.5
Last Changelog of Mafuba Box Wipe
<ul>
<li>Nerfed the explosion damage on Meteor Storm; theoretically, this means that only the excessive wounds the skill causes are removed.</li>
<li>Some Elemental Defense fixes.</li>
<li>Some wound changes. Immediate wound death should be more rare now but RP mode won't stop the wound timer still - cause that's too ez to cheezy.</li>
<li>Being immune to injury should protect your form BP wounds even if you get immediatelly knocked out into the injury zone. Zane's Ls continue to improve the game.</li>
<li>Susanoo now gives super armor and has a set health cost instead of constant drain.</li>
<li>Certain buffs (Vaizard and Susanoo) can be shattered by breaking their super armor. Expect bugs and hilarity in the pursuit of sticking to canon.</li>
<li>Some unarmed T4 advanced stances got really fucking gay in the theme of 'fuck swords' campaign.</li>
</ul>
4/4/2017 10.1.3.4.b
Continued continous slight improvement...(New month, new changelog, who dis?)
<ul>
<li>Finally made a check for Duel so that you can't leave people in it, target yourself to go into it or leave it, and might even stop you from some gentle workarounds!  We'll see.</li>
<li>Made a Refund RPP verb for admins so we can help you correct your bad decisions at double time!</li>
<li>Soul Tear Storm has had the damage ceiling lowered a bit.</li>
<li>Autohits have been looked funny at.</li>
<li>Super Saiyan Grades don't make you a cyborg anymore.  Crazy, right?</li>
<li>Added in a passive to duplicate Drunken Fist AIS/WS boosting.</li>
<li>Mafuba is an actual technique now.</li>
<li>Swords were given a lookover and number tweak, they experience lowered effectivness from various secondary effects too.</li>
<li>Haki things.</li>
<li>Telepathy shenanigans.</li>
<li>Sunlight Stance now has a minimum damage value, which always makes it enablement and never a nerf.</li>
</ul>
3/27/2017 10.1.3.4
Continuous slight improvement...
<ul>
<li>Added in Mask objects, which currently can only be obtained from admins.  When worn, these will replace your base icon, change your text color, and swap your profile for a defined one.</li>
<li>Added profile and text color mimicking to Imitate.  Mess with your friends for fun and profit!</li>
<li>Added a Pose verb for those aspiring sprite artists who would like to make an idle animation.  It uses the old 'Train' state.</li>
<li>Spirit Sword variables made a bit more flexible.</li>
<li>Small buff affecting all Super Stances due to their existing restrictions. We listen, we test, we evolve.</li>
<li>Small addition to Throw- Tryhar- Throwaway(!) Humans.</li>
<li>Buffs can now accept custom hitsparks.</li>
<li>KiBlade has been made into a slotless buff, in line with nuBuffs.</li>
<li>Demon Burst has been made into a special buff, in line with nuBuffs.</li>
<li>Alien BP nerfed. May need to call your local admin to fix you up. Also, if you were transformed before the update, revert and reset multipliers.</li>
<li>Nobody BP buffed.</li>
<li>The bug which prevented Kaioken from being used with a non-armor buff has been rectified.  Yet more evidence that I must rework everything to be <b>more elegant</b>...</li>
<li>Custom Hit Sparks can properly face different directions now.  It shouldn't matter how many dir states the icon has; after all, the default slash effect only has one.</li>
<li>Being modified by cyberize or self enhancement progressively seals your anger.  Different categories seal different amounts of anger.  From lowest to highest effects: passives, BP, stats, active skills.</li>
<li>CyberPower is enhanced by your power up ratio, but not anger.</li>
<li>Godspeed made less movement speed-y.  It slashes your delay in half rather than setting it to 0.1.  Sometimes, memes have to stay as dreams...</li>
<li>Burst Regeneration was buffed in virtually every aspect with higher Regeneration mods affecting it even more strongly.</li>
<li>Spudz donated a cleaner looking expanded Makyojin icon.  Thanks, Spudz.</li>
<li>Added a new, locked class of Monster, Shinzoku.  They combine non-malicious traits of all Monster classes and feature artificially inflated BP.  They are arguably benevolent in nature.</li>
<li>Kaios are now called Shinjin.</li>
<li>CDs bumped up on a couple of special skills. Now we justneed to disable timers ticking down in RP mode.</li>
<li>Warp strikes removed from all tree buffs as relatively undesirable property.</li>
<li>Launcher property temporarily disabled till we figure a way to deal with misalignment it causes.</li>
<li>One Inch Punch nerfed; maybe-fix for Dragon Dashing through windups.</li>
<li>Fixed some bugs regarding Super Alien stat mods.</li>
<li>Jagan Eye no longer seals your anger for having Internal Scouter.</li>
</ul>
3/25/2017
DBR EDITION 10.1.3.3
I'm Yan and I continue to write changelogs sometimes.  I'll probably give up soon.
<ul>
<li>Demons now operate as fully ascended half-demons, and their single transformation gives the same power that a half-demon using both of their's would give.  They are very dangerous!</li>
<li>Monsters have new flavor text to better represent their status as <b><font size=+2>ELITE MOOKS</font size></b>.  Just in case anyone was wondering.</li>
<li>Oozaru now locks out the user from being buffed; previously, it only removed any current buffs.</li>
</ul>
3/19/2017
DBR EDITION 10.1.3.2
I'm Yan and I write changelogs sometimes.
<ul>
<li>Recovery now affects the charge time of energy attacks.</li>
<li>Auras no longer troll Zane Hataro (The Legend) specifically.  Sorry, Zane.</li>
<li>Everything -- everything!! -- gets tracked when you buy things off the skill tree.  No more weird RPP discrepencies.</li>
<li>Battle Mage advanced stance and Arcane Bladework can be used together, despite the two being otherwise incompatible.</li>
<li>Judo Flip will only throw one tile.</li>
<li>Unsurprisingly, more Alien shit (mostly icons)</li>

</ul>
3/11/2017
DBR EDITION 10.1.3.1
Less changelog title ideas than character ideas...
<ul>
<li>Aliens/Monsters get an additional base icon choice.
<li>Additional animal trait: bull horns.
<li>Small tap down of energy costs on melee moves.
<li>Slightly faster knockbacks.
<li>A number of Sense and Scouter modifications. Sense no longer identifies power sources. Scouters no longer show target's energy. Internal scouters do not bug out anymore (effectively unlimited BP range).
</ul>
3/10/2017
DBR EDITION 10.1.3
Welcome to Class 13!
<ul>
<li>Huge rework of Autohit hitboxes and hitsparks - much more variation and options available within.
<li>On hit-effects on Autohits - elemental themed ones may now start popping up more often.
<li>Tech doubling fixed. Tech tree subbing points in strange manner fixed. Cybernetics slightly modified. Internal comms can now communicate with scouters and comms properly.
<li>Light and Dark swords now offer new effects.
<li>New skills, both on the tree and the application list.
<li>New advanced stances, introduction of sword stances.
<li>Neo New Kaioken and Burning Shot. Two more Cardinal buffs in works.
<li>New Oozaru. Scarier, maybe?
<li>Buffs can provide aura replacement. I know how beloved aura stacking is but no.
<li>WOODEN SWORDS - for all you deliquent fucks.
<li>Speed rework - more influence over movement speed, bit different way in affecting hit and dodge rate.
<li>Expand and Super Expand are functionally different choices for Makyojin.
<li>Lots of wound mechanic changes, auto-wounding when suffering a KO with certain injury %, regenerators now assist with healing wounds with proper upgrades, mortal wounds cause bleedout instead of random instakills, medkits stop bleeding out.
<li>Regeneration and Healing skills affect wounds and maims.
<li>Sequentials work. More of them soon.
<li>No more drain HUD bugs on buffs.
<li>Reworked Yin Yang Stance and Spirit Style. Former is more dynamic, latter can refine even super stances.
<li>More Alien Racials, more icon choices, animal trait options! Customize to heart's content.
</ul>
1/16/2017
DBR EDITION 10.1.2
I have a morning shift tommorow, death wouldn't be unwelcome
<ul>
<li>First truly fancy *new* Tier 4 signature - OverSoul. Currently only for Kusanagi Weapon Soul, but rest will be quicker to make from now on.
<li>Couple nerfs and buffs here and there. Monsters of third ascension should quickly report to admins for fixes. Likewise *extremely long sigh* Agorothians.
<li>SSJ2 now gets a properly HUGE aura. Also, first uses of SSJ1 and SSJ2 are free of transformation drain. PU drain-out reversion, Recovery nerfs and slower energy regeneration are still a thing, so better keep mastering rather than thinking how to cheese.
<li>Autohits no longer can be used while meditating, KO'd, stunned etc. Side effect may be no longer being able to use them while Dragon Dashing. The latter may require so called 'git gud' technique to adjust.
<li>Swords and Staves no longer will slap their elemental enchant permanently on the user. Thanks Raff for noticing.
</ul>
1/7/2017
DBR EDITION 10.1.1
We need to get here more often.
<ul>
<li>More transformation adjustments. If you're transformed at the time of reading this, quickly revert (unless you've got Cyber BP) and inform your nearest admin. They'll reset your values to proper ones.
<li>Some changes to some projectile calculations. Ansatsuken is a dead art so this most likely will not matter.
<li>New/Old Appable Skill: Titan Form - it makes you big, it makes you strong, it makes you big and strong.
<li>Nerve Shot is less unnerving. Blaze Burst less burny.
</ul>
1/5/2017
DBR EDITION 10.1.0
Moderately Satisfying New Year
<ul>
<li>Some small Full Power SSJ changes. If you're a Saiyan, A-Help for Reset of your SSJ variables (but remember to revert first)
<li>Super Namekian moved down to current trans tier till they're properly rebalanced. IF you're a Namek, A-Help for Reset of your transformation variables.
<li>Gates mechanics slightly updated (the was a minor cooldown inconsistency caused by how buff system works at the moment) but a proper 'go up one' verb will still need to wait for Jinx.
<li>Nano-Boost nerf.
<li>Enhanced Intellect is now a Passive module meaning it's accessible for all races. Meaning Cyberfreaks and Tuffles (after rework) will have automatic access to it, too. Performance Modules will become Intellect gated (making them harder to put on Monsters) and Active Modules will still require two Intel Enhancements to unlock.
</ul>
12/30/2016
DBR EDITION 10.0.999
Of blood, bots and blunders.
<ul>
<li>Typo fixes. Lots of them.
<li>Changes on Life Steal math making it still good but less ~*~ABSOLUTELY CRAZY~*~ (in general it won't heal more health than it hits for anymore)
<li>Fixed Overdrive maths that made the PU ceiling go 100% too high (cause it counted in the base 100% you normally have in the doubling)
<li>Androids get less mileage from Overdrive while suffering less strain - similar to old Overdrive, meant to carry them through transitional eras. Corresponding Cyber BP scaling nerf.
<li>Androids don't get the Cyber Limb var ticked by Replacement Limb. It just... gives them a new limb. This means no Power Mult buff from Overdrive ever.
<li>Signatures provided by Cyberize should now properly check if the person has a Tier S.
<li>SSJ mastery fixes. After looking into the ages old code for drains, the stoppage of drain at 75% mastery was actually unintended. Grade 2/Grade 3 buffs adjusted in response.
<li>Transformed people can once again recover fatigue... really, really slowly.
<li>Multiple adjustments to Gates. Mostly extending timers and reducing drains, but Gates Nerf now locks other buffs so folks don't get to cheese their Gate of Healing. Starting to draw up frames for signature moves.
<li>New Alien Racial: Cyberfreak - allows them to start with Self-Enhancement (basically old cyberize that can only target yourself) and an Intelligence boost.
<li>New Passive: Pursuer - harshly lowers Dragon Dash cooldown on certain timed buffs. Since D-Dash doesn't provide a free heavy shot and Pursuit isn't in anymore, this should not kill fun forever. Should not.
<li>New Skill Tree Stuff (continued): Pinpoint Blast, our second Force-based autohit, except this one properly hits resistance. It makes a boom when you hit.
<li>New Appable Stuff: The Claw - a Tier 1 queuable move that allows you to be brolic and slam your hand into someone's face, automatically grabbing them after performing the move. Grab moves really got no love for a while, consider this a little kiss.
</ul>
12/29/2016
DBR EDITION 10.0.99
Problems, but a trans ain't one!
<ul>
<li>Many trans issues fixed, some transes made more interesting visually.
<li>Balance changes. This doesn't mean things are balanced, only that they're different. ( ;_; )
<li>Cyberize price changes. Things are bit cheaper now.
<li>New Skill Tree Stuff: Scatter Shot - a shotgun-like blast with short range but greater radius than the normal Charge.
</ul>
12/27/2016
DBR EDITION 10.0.9
So I heard you like cyber? What a coincidence, so do I!
<ul>
<li>Small Vaizard fixes, bugs should be harder to trigger though not impossible due to nature of BYOND.
<li>Buffs for multiple queueable moves.
<li>Multiple changes to cyberize: expanding the list of races able to undergo augmentation, introducing new modules, ability to replace lost limbs with cybernetic implants.
<li>New module/buff: Nano-Boost, an immediate and temporary burst of cyber power based on the current Cyber BP cap.
<li>New appable unarmed move! Gale Strike (Tier 1) - punch with enough power to create a blast of air strong enough to send the opponent flying even if the fist itself missed them!
</ul>
12/19/2016
DBR EDITION 10.0.8.8.8.8.8....
Melancholy of Kokutou: Endless Eight
<ul>
<li>Shoryuken and Spin Rave issues fixed. Shoryuken is still a bit quirky (praise Kencode) but should be harder to break.
<li>Many small stance inconsistencies fixed.
<li>Tsunami Strike slashed in price since I dunno how to buff it at the moment, ask for a partial refund if you bought it before the update.
<li>Southpaw stance is back! Now working as intended... mostly.
<li>Android changes motivated by both bias and balance. They should be touch more unique now.
<li>Dhampir ascension two finished. Vampires and Dhampirs now get Absorb, but instead grabbing BP and energy, they scale their Frenzy of the number of folks they drank to death. Infecting someone with vampirism also provides said scaling, albeit at a lower rate.
<li>Some small dabs on transformations. Mostly bugfixes and still work in progress. SSJ made more imposing :3c
<li>Jecht Shot and Sokidan now home till their control system is functional again.
<li>New Skill Tree Stuff: (Unarmed) - Nerve Shot, which scrambles opponent's controls if it hits, Uppercut, which launches them in the air for a short moment, opening for another move and Roundhouse Kick - an autohit with an arcing hitbox; (Misc) - Dancing Lights, a queueable move which hovers homing blasts around the user, launching at the opponent every time they hit them in the duration.
<li>Wound tresholds increased in the loving memory of Mourningstar.
<li>Mostly bugfixes and buffs to fresh moves.
<li>Berserk Vaizard a bit more containable.
<li>New/old buffs: Overdrive - which increases the performance of all cybernetics at the cost of steady drain and taking away Power Up as it goes away and Super Saiyan Grade 2/3 - well known, well loved ways to get even more swole as a Saiyan
</ul>
12/16/2016
DBR EDITION 10.0.8.8
Oneshots - People weren't missing them as much as they seem to do.
<ul>
<li>Speedforce afterimages nerfed!
<li>...some other things too.
<li>Preparing the framework for Aliens to gain additional passive abilities in Trans 1. It's not hard to say what my favourite race is, is it.
<li>...but don't worry, since others get some goodies too! Couple ascension adjustments already in.
</ul>
12/15/2016
DBR EDITION 10.0.8.8
Oneshots - People weren't missing them as much as they seem to do.
<ul>
<li>Ki's most likely saner, but still strong.
<li>Bigger Ki attacks are also more telegraphed. Expecting a number of complaints, timings still open to adjustment.
<li>Spirit Sword and Weapon Soul get a new command: Transfigure - it's in the Skills Tab and allows them to adjust icon like the old ones but also adjust their weapon class.
<li>Every time I look back at Kaioken I just want to make a new alien racial...

DBR EDITION 10.0.8
'We have this cool new stuff but it doesn't do anything yet- wow, a lot of this recently, huh'
<ul>
<li>Even more fixes. It's like they never end, you see?</li>
<li>*some silent grumbling about Kaioken*</li>
<li>Queued moves now can queue other queues. Queueception. No moves like this are in yet, though.</li>
<li>Drain bugs on things fixed by making them timers rather than drains. Easiest way to solve an issue is obviously avoiding it. What a good lifelesson.</li>

<b><size=+2>THE GRAND CHANGELOG</size></b>
9/22/2016
DBR VERSION 10.0.0
<UL>
<li>All of the BattleSystem code has been scrutinized and optimized.</li>
<li>Reworked the system of elements.</li>
<li>Reworked all existing advanced stances and added in many new ones.</li>
<li>Level 4 Admins can now determine if death can be voided from.</li>
<li>KiBlade's accuracy was nerfed regardless of if you have a sword on or not.  Swords had their Ki Blade offense nerf removed.</li>
<li>'Holy' mechanics were made so that they apply to all damage, not just punches.</li>
<li>Poison works once again!!!</li>
<li>Saiyan anger scaling mechanics have been added back in.  They'll even compensate for higher levels of anger than usual!!</li>
<li>Along the same lines, Saiyans no longer have buff slots or special slots.</li>
<li>Speaking of active and special slots, the buffs system was reworked.  The numbers were pointless and now buffs can be made much more easily.</li>
<li>Knockback no longer waits until after the shockwave of a strike has faded. The actual speed that people fly at has also been boosted considerably.</li>
<li>Pursuit was removed.</li>
<li>Titan Form was nerfed to be usable; Titan Shifters were removed.</li>
<li>Agorothians were fully updated.  I'll leave it to Raffness to make any lore posts about them for the public...</li>
<li>Humans have four ascensions; spirit dolls have been removed and are simply a branch of humans that can be decided at their first ascension.</li>
<li>Youkai have been removed. <s>for now</s></li>
<li>MYOR have been removed.</li>
<li>Nerfed every race in the game.  You thought I was joking?</li>
<li>Nerfed every buff in the game.</li>
<li>Pruned many variables that have no use any longer.</li>
<li>Diminishing returns dimish returns more.</li>
<li>Lethal and Wound intent now make public messages.</li>
<li>Assess is removed.  again.</li>
<li>Added a crowd target toggle.  If you are targetting the crowd, then you will hit anyone that you mechanically run into; if you are not, then you only do damage to your target.</li>
<li>A 'Speed Save' verb was added.  If you want to try to kill someone, use this to calculate a value that anyone who'd like to try to save the person you're killing must beat.  Pretty much an optional feature...</li>
<li>Projectiles feature the same calculations as melee damage now.  This will, in general, appear to be a nerf to their damage.</li>
<li>Made all projectiles in the game into Feva projectiles.  Solidarity, ho.</li>
