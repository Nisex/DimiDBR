/*

Tomes:
    as they are you can keep adding pages (levels) to make it so u have an inf capacity of a tome
    tomes should have tiers or something that dictate the limit of their pages
    tome should grant the ability to use the spells in it, and with translate you can learn them
    you have a limit based on ur magic level of how many tome spells you can learn.
    tomes should be able to be upgraded to increase their limit, but they have a MAX based on tier


    turn scrolls into 1 time usages that don't gimp the spell inside, this way the person can make scrolls for people

    secruity is fine (password protected)

    cleansing is also somewhat fine
        - cant cleanse a spell that has been translated

    Bindin
        - binding should happen on extremely rare tomes, vs just any tome
        - people can app for get their shit binded if it gets to the legedendary point
        - probably invole a philo stone for automation
